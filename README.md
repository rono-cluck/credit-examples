scripts to estimate debt payoff terms

I'm just getting started.  

written for python 2.7

ps2.1.py
  input raw_inputs as int or float
  given:
    begining balance, 
    annual interest rate, 
    and the % of the balance that must be paid for a minimum payment
    the script will return the total paid after 12 months, the interest accrued, and the remaining balance
    
    
ps2.1.py
  input raw_inputs as int or float
  given:
    beginning balance and annual interest rate
    the script will calculate how much you must pay monthly to have a $0 balance in 12 months
    
Use and modify this script freely for your own needs.  
But please, do not present this as your own work, especially towards acedemic achievement.
In other words, do your own homework.
