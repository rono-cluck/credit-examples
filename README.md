scripts to estimate debt payoff terms

I'm just getting started.  These were only created as a learning exercise for loops and functions and are not intended to actually return financial advice.

written for python 2.7

ps2.1.py
  input raw_inputs as int or float
  given:
    beginning balance, 
    annual interest rate, 
    and the % of the balance that must be paid for a minimum payment
    the script will return the total paid after 12 months, the interest accrued, and the remaining balance
    
    
ps2.1.py
  input raw_inputs as int or float
  given:
    beginning balance and annual interest rate
    the script will calculate how much you must pay monthly to have a $0 balance in 12 months
    
Use and modify this script freely for your own needs.  
But please, do not present this as your own work, especially to meet academic requirements.
Do your own homework, dude.
